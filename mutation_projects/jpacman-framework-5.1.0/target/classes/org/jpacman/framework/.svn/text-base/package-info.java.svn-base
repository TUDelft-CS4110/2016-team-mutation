/**
  * The JPacman framework.
  * 
  * The model, view, and controller are in the packages
  * named accordingly.
  *
  * The factory package can be used to create models,
  * whereas the UI contains the actual user interface.
  * 
  * The framework can be used to create all sorts of
  * JPacman games: The typical way would be to inherit from
  * several of the framework classes, refine the behavior as 
  * desired, and use the factories to ensure the proper classes
  * are indeed instantiated.
