    /**
     * Declares the scope of the synchronization monitor this {@link BuildStep} expects from outside.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * This method is introduced for preserving compatibility with plugins written for earlier versions of Hudson,
     * which never run multiple builds of the same job in parallel. Such plugins often assume that the outcome
     * of the previous build is completely available, which is no longer true when we do concurrent builds.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * To minimize the necessary code change for such plugins, {@link BuildStep} implementations can request
     * Hudson to externally perform synchronization before executing them. This behavior is as follows:
     *
     * &lt;dl&gt;
     * &lt;dt&gt;{@link BuildStepMonitor#BUILD}
     * &lt;dd&gt;
     * This {@link BuildStep} is only executed after the previous build is fully
     * completed (thus fully restoring the earlier semantics of one build at a time.)
     *
     * &lt;dt&gt;{@link BuildStepMonitor#STEP}
     * &lt;dd&gt;
     * This {@link BuildStep} is only executed after the same step in the previous build is completed.
     * For build steps that use a weaker assumption and only rely on the output from the same build step of
     * the early builds, this improves the concurrency.
     *
     * &lt;dt&gt;{@link BuildStepMonitor#NONE}
     * &lt;dd&gt;
     * No external synchronization is performed on this build step. This is the most efficient, and thus
     * &lt;b&gt;the recommended value for newer plugins&lt;/b&gt;. Wherever necessary, you can directly use {@link CheckPoint}s
     * to perform necessary synchronizations.
     * &lt;/dl&gt;
     *
     * &lt;h2&gt;Migrating Older Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * If you are migrating {@link BuildStep} implementations written for earlier versions of Hudson,
     * here's what you can do:
     *
     * &lt;ul&gt;
     * &lt;li&gt;
     * Just return {@link BuildStepMonitor#BUILD} to demand the backward compatible behavior from Hudson,
     * and make no other changes to the code. This will prevent users from reaping the benefits of concurrent
     * builds, but at least your plugin will work correctly, and therefore this is a good easy first step.
     * &lt;li&gt;
     * If your build step doesn't use anything from a previous build (for example, if you don't even call
     * {@link Run#getPreviousBuild()}), then you can return {@link BuildStepMonitor#NONE} without making further
     * code changes and you are done with migration.
     * &lt;li&gt;
     * If your build step only depends on {@link Action}s that you added in the previous build by yourself,
     * then you only need {@link BuildStepMonitor#STEP} scope synchronization. Return it from this method
     * ,and you are done with migration without any further code changes.
     * &lt;li&gt;
     * If your build step makes more complex assumptions, return {@link BuildStepMonitor#NONE} and use
     * {@link CheckPoint}s directly in your code. The general idea is to call {@link CheckPoint#block()} before
     * you try to access the state from the previous build.
     * &lt;/ul&gt;
     *
     * &lt;h2&gt;Note to caller&lt;/h2&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * For plugins written against earlier versions of Hudson, calling this method results in
     * {@link AbstractMethodError}.
