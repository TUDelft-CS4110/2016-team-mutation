 * Pluggability point for performing pre/post actions for the build process.

 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This extension point enables a plugin to set up / tear down additional
 * services needed to perform a build, such as setting up local X display,
 * or launching and stopping application servers for testing.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An instance of {@link BuildWrapper} is associated with a {@link Project}
 * with configuration information as its state. An instance is persisted
 * along with {@link Project}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * {@link BuildWrapper}s are instantiated when the user saves the job configuration, and sticks
 * around in memory until the job configuration is overwritten.
 *
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The {@link #setUp(Build,Launcher,BuildListener)} method is invoked for each build.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * {@link BuildWrapper} requires an user consent (in terms of a checkbox) to work.
 * If this is not desirable, see {@link hudson.model.Environment} for other ways
 * to inject Environments to builds.
