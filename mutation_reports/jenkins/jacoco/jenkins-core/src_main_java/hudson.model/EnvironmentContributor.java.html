/**
 * Contributes environment variables to builds.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This extension point can be used to externally add environment variables. Aside from adding environment variables
 * of the fixed name, a typical strategy is to look for specific {@link JobProperty}s and other similar configurations
 * of {@link Job}s to compute values.
 *
 * &lt;h2&gt;Views&lt;/h2&gt;
 * &lt;h4&gt;buildEnv.groovy/.jelly&lt;/h4&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * When Jenkins displays the help page listing all the environment variables available for a build, it does
 * so by combining all the {@code buildEnv} views from this extension point. This view should use the &amp;lt;t:buildEnvVar&gt; tag
 * to render a variable.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * In this view, {@code it} points to {@link EnvironmentContributor} and {@code job} points to {@link Job} for which
 * the help is being rendered.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Jenkins provides other extension points (such as {@link SCM}) to contribute environment variables to builds,
 * and for those plugins, Jenkins also looks for {@code /buildEnv.groovy} and aggregates them.
