/**
 * Represents an exception that indicates that a Subscriber or operator attempted to apply reactive pull
 * backpressure to an Observable that does not implement it.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If an Observable has not been written to support reactive pull backpressure (such support is not a
 * requirement for Observables), you can apply one of the following operators to it, each of which forces a
 * simple form of backpressure behavior:
 * &lt;dl&gt;
 *  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;onBackpressureBuffer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
 *   &lt;dd&gt;maintains a buffer of all emissions from the source Observable and emits them to downstream Subscribers
 *       according to the requests they generate&lt;/dd&gt;
 *  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;onBackpressureDrop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
 *   &lt;dd&gt;drops emissions from the source Observable unless there is a pending request from a downstream
 *       Subscriber, in which case it will emit enough items to fulfill the request&lt;/dd&gt;
 * &lt;/dl&gt;
 * If you do not apply either of these operators to an Observable that does not support backpressure, and if
 * either you as the Subscriber or some operator between you and the Observable attempts to apply reactive pull
 * backpressure, you will encounter a {@code MissingBackpressureException} which you will be notified of via
 * your {@code onError} callback.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * There are, however, other options. You can throttle an over-producing Observable with operators like
 * {@code sample}/{@code throttleLast}, {@code throttleFirst}, or {@code throttleWithTimeout}/{@code debounce}.
 * You can also take the large number of items emitted by an over-producing Observable and package them into
 * a smaller set of emissions by using operators like {@code buffer} and {@code window}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * For a more complete discussion of the options available to you for dealing with issues related to
 * backpressure and flow control in RxJava, see
 * &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Backpressure&quot;&gt;RxJava wiki: Backpressure&lt;/a&gt;.
