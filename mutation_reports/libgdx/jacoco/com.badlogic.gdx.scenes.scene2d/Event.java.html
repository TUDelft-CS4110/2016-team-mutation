/** The base class for all events.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * By default an event will &quot;bubble&quot; up through an actor's parent's handlers (see {@link #setBubbles(boolean)}).
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An actor's capture listeners can {@link #stop()} an event to prevent child actors from seeing it.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An Event may be marked as &quot;handled&quot; which will end its propagation outside of the Stage (see {@link #handle()}). The default
 * {@link Actor#fire(Event)} will mark events handled if an {@link EventListener} returns true.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A cancelled event will be stopped and handled. Additionally, many actors will undo the side-effects of a canceled event. (See
 * {@link #cancel()}.)
