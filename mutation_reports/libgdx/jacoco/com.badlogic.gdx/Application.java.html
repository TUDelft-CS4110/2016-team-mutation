/** &lt;p&gt;
 * An &lt;code&gt;Application&lt;/code&gt; is the main entry point of your project. It sets up a window and rendering surface and manages the
 * different aspects of your application, namely {@link Graphics}, {@link Audio}, {@link Input} and {@link Files}. Think of an
 * Application being equivalent to Swing's &lt;code&gt;JFrame&lt;/code&gt; or Android's &lt;code&gt;Activity&lt;/code&gt;.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An application can be an instance of any of the following:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;a desktop application (see &lt;code&gt;JglfwApplication&lt;/code&gt; found in gdx-backends-jglfw.jar)&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;an Android application (see &lt;code&gt;AndroidApplication&lt;/code&gt; found in gdx-backends-android.jar)&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;a HTML5 application (see &lt;code&gt;GwtApplication&lt;/code&gt; found in gdx-backends-gwt.jar)&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;an iOS application (see &lt;code&gt;IOSApplication&lt;/code&gt; found in gdx-backends-robovm.jar)&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * Each application class has it's own startup and initialization methods. Please refer to their documentation for more
 * information.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * While game programmers are used to having a main loop, libgdx employs a different concept to accommodate the event based nature
 * of Android applications a little more. You application logic must be implemented in a {@link ApplicationListener} which has
 * methods that get called by the Application when the application is created, resumed, paused, disposed or rendered. As a
 * developer you will simply implement the ApplicationListener interface and fill in the functionality accordingly. The
 * ApplicationListener is provided to a concrete Application instance as a parameter to the constructor or another initialization
 * method. Please refer to the documentation of the Application implementations for more information. Note that the
 * ApplicationListener can be provided to any Application implementation. This means that you only need to write your program
 * logic once and have it run on different platforms by passing it to a concrete Application implementation.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The Application interface provides you with a set of modules for graphics, audio, input and file i/o.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * {@link Graphics} offers you various methods to output visuals to the screen. This is achieved via OpenGL ES 2.0 or 3.0
 * depending on what's available an the platform. On the desktop the features of OpenGL ES 2.0 and 3.0 are emulated via desktop
 * OpenGL. On Android the functionality of the Java OpenGL ES bindings is used.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * {@link Audio} offers you various methods to output and record sound and music. This is achieved via the Java Sound API on the
 * desktop. On Android the Android media framework is used.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * {@link Input} offers you various methods to poll user input from the keyboard, touch screen, mouse and accelerometer.
 * Additionally you can implement an {@link InputProcessor} and use it with {@link Input#setInputProcessor(InputProcessor)} to
 * receive input events.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * {@link Files} offers you various methods to access internal and external files. An internal file is a file that is stored near
 * your application. On Android internal files are equivalent to assets. On the desktop the classpath is first scanned for the
 * specified file. If that fails then the root directory of your application is used for a look up. External files are resources
 * you create in your application and write to an external storage. On Android external files reside on the SD-card, on the
 * desktop external files are written to a users home directory. If you know what you are doing you can also specify absolute file
 * names. Absolute filenames are not portable, so take great care when using this feature.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * {@link Net} offers you various methods to perform network operations, such as performing HTTP requests, or creating server and
 * client sockets for more elaborate network programming.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The &lt;code&gt;Application&lt;/code&gt; also has a set of methods that you can use to query specific information such as the operating
 * system the application is currently running on and so forth. This allows you to have operating system dependent code paths. It
 * is however not recommended to use this facilities.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The &lt;code&gt;Application&lt;/code&gt; also has a simple logging method which will print to standard out on the desktop and to logcat on
 * Android.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
